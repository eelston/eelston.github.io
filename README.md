This website currently serves as a small portfolio, holding a couple projects and their informal write ups, as well as some information about me. The site is handwritten in HTML and may be a little inconsistent, as I am learning as I go.

TODO:

- ~~finish screen width response for home page and project directory~~
- combine repeated css values where needed
- ~~navbar hover color when highlighted~~
