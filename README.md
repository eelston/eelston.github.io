This website currently serves as a small portfolio, holding a couple projects and their informal write ups, as well as some information about me. The site is handwritten in HTML and may be a little inconsistent, as I am learning as I go.

TODO:
- Fix jittery screen width response
- Consolidate color palette
- Fix some CSS redundancies
- JS?
- File organization
- Hover on project directory
