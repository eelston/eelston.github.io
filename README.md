This website currently serves as a small portfolio, holding a couple projects and their informal write ups, as well as some information about me. The site is handwritten in HTML and may be a little inconsistent, as I am learning as I go.

TODO:
- mess with screen width response again... i dont really like the 90% solution since it's a bit jittery(?), especially noticable on the project directory page and in the navbar. maybe ok to keep for the text only stuff though
- combine repeated css values where needed
- adjust color palette (shrink a bit.. too many colors + need naming scheme to match)
