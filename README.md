This website currently serves as a small portfolio, holding a couple projects and their informal write ups, as well as some information about me. The site is handwritten in HTML and may be a little inconsistent, as I am learning as I go. 


TODO:
- default link color
- change project list div to main?
- get text centered for mobile screens
- project page formatting on mobile (esp title section)
