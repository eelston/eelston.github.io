            <h2>Background and Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                In Spring 2023, I took 198DP, a weekly 3 hour hands-on electronics lab centered around working with the KIM-1 single-board computer.
                The course aimed to help freshman and sophomore ECE majors grow familiar with reading datasheets, assembly language programming, and basic circuit theory.
                Throughout the semester, we worked with various LEDs, integrated circuits, and other electronic components.
                <br><br>
                The final 3 or 4 class meetings focused on allowing us to develop individual projects involving the KIM-1 and any choice of sound, light, and/or mechanical components.
                Some of my peers created games or music-based projects! My project primarily involved an 8x8 LED grid and the keyboard of the KIM-1.
                <br><br>
                After drafting designs corresponding to each key A-F and determining the order in which to send in the LED data (the DotStar takes in data serially--or a pixel at a time),
                I first tested various color combinations on a 1-2 rows of each pattern and reworked the RGB and brightness values as needed.
                To cut down on testing time, I wrote a quick Python script that took a text file with colors written in plain text and produced the appropriate assembly language instructions
                for each LED, allowing me to adjust and test the look of different RGB values quickly. 
                <br><br>
                When I moved on to testing the 8x8 patterns in full, only about half of my patterns were showing up on the grid and
                I realized the initial memory location I was loading the LED instructions to didn't have enough space for all 256 bytes of information.
                Luckily, the KIM-1 clone by Corsham actually included additional RAM ("RAM from 2000 to FFF7. The KIM-1 had nothing past 1FFF") and I was able to adjust the start address easily and avoid any additional memory-related issues.
                <br><br>
                Some additional details are included in the presentation attached below. While not super complicated, this project and the course as a whole introduced me to a lot of fundamental skills
                that I've found useful in other classes since. I appreciated being given room for creativity and problem solving, while being encouraged to ask questions and learn from mistakes.
                This course inspired me to propose the creation of an additional experiential learning course focusing giving students the opportunity to work on a semester long project with regular instructor guidance,
                as a sort of stepping stone between 197DP and the junior & senior design projects.
